# LinguaGlass

LinguaGlass is a iOS application designed for immersive reading for language learners. Extract text from the web and tap any word to reveal its meaning. Heavily inspired by [KantanManga](https://github.com/juanj/KantanManga). Primarily built to enable the language learners to read manga/manhwa easier.

Note: This is one of my first coding projects, so the code may be messy and unclear.

Contact the developer at linguaglass@gmail.com for bug reports or additional language support/feature requests.

- **Live Text Mode**
